# Stub for unimplemented Steps

## Generate Code for Simple Unimplemented step
* create Project in temporary directory "data/generatestubs"
* pre-requisite "data/generatestubs"
* get stubs for unimplemented steps for project with details "specs/generateStubs"
* ensure diagnostics verified

## Get Implementation Files
* open project "data/generatestubs"
* get implementation files

## Should generate new Concept files
* open project "data/generatestubs"
* generate concept "name" in new file under "specs" and verify

## Should generate existing Concept files
* open project "data/generatestubs"
* generate concept "name" in file "conceptExample.cpt" of "specs" and verify
